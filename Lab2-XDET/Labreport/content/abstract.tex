The scope of this experiment is to identify firstly the elements, and secondly the chemical state of an unknown sample by using the 
measurement technique of X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction. By comparing the spectra with sufficient data basis and combining the results from both techniques a partially oxidized cupper sample can be assumed.
