\label{sec:Conclusion}

Following this experiment of X-ray fluorescence and diffraction a undefined sample could be analyzed and identified in two steps as a partially oxidized cupper.
As discrepancies arrised between the two techniques, it becomes clear how important it is to combine experimental techniques and also interpret the measuremnent carefully.
Nethertheless, this contactless and not destructive methodogy proofs to be a powerful tool for material analysis, when a sufficient data basis is aviable.
