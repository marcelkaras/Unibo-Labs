\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

X-ray fluorescence is the emission of secondary, element characteristic x-rays due to an exctation by high-energy X- or gammarays.
So, by comparing the fluorescence spectrum of an unknown sample with the spectra of known ones, the specimen can be easily identified.
Further, by X-ray diffraction the christallography can be analyzed, as the diffraction pattern depends on the lattice parameters.
In more detail, the scattering potential, and thus the electons density of the threedimensional sample has an characteristic diffraction pattern.
From this, the atoms positions, the chemical bonds and also christallographic disorders can be determined.

\subsection{Experimental setup}
\label{sec:setup}

For the fluorescence measurement as a high-energy X-ray source $\ce{^{133}Ba}$ is used. 
The sample (Sample B) is positioned in a sample holder between the source and a $\ce{Si}$ detector.
This is connected with a multichannelanalyzer and then with a PC.
It is important to notice that the X-ray source is $\ce{^{133}Ba}$ and thus decays into $\ce{Cs}$ by electron capture.
Thus, the main emitted X-ray signal is at the energy of the $\alpha$ peak of $\ce{Cs}$, which is $\SI{30.972}{\kilo\eV}$ \cite{Ba-source}.

The diffraction measurement is done on a rotatable stage, where also a monochromator is introduced between the sample and the detector.

\subsection{Energy scaling}
\label{sec:E_scaling}
As the output of the multichannelanalyzer (MCA) is counts per bin, but one wants to refer the wavelegth and thus an energy out of the channel, 
spectral measurements for several samples are done.
The characteristic spectral peak of the sample is found, so that tuples of bin number and energy can be found.
By a linear regression a function $E (\text{b})$  of the bin $b$ can be found.
