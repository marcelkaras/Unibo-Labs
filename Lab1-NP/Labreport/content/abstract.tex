Quantum dots made out of semiconductor materials have tuneable optical properties defined by quantum confinement and material mixture. 
Here, the concentration of Selenium and Sulfur in a quantum confined material can be determined by a photoluminescence measurement,
where the measured Sulfur concentrations reach from $\SIrange{19}{100}{\percent}$. Also a changing of the materials bandgap proportional to the concentration 
of $\SIrange{1.8}{2.6}{\eV}$ could be determined.
