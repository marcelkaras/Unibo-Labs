%     \delta E &= \frac{E_\text{LED} - E_\text{Laser}}{E_\text{LED}} \\
%     \delta E_\text{A} &= \SI{2.4}{\percent} \\

It is difficult at this stage to predict whether research efforts in
% organic spintronics will lead to their implementation into actual devices. At present, organic spintronics can be regarded as a fascinating puzzle in which many pieces are still missing. The electronic properties of OSCs are radically different from those of such band semiconductors as Si or GaAs. Consequently, their spin properties are also different \cite{valve}
