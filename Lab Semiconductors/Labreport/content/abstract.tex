Organic semiconductors have unique properties such as elasticity, optoelectric interactions and designability,
but also low cost. Spintronics is a new pathway of computing design promising, faster, smaller and energy efficient devices.
As in this field, classic semiconductors are missing the opportunity of transferring spin-information sufficient enough, organic semiconductors can be used,
as due to low spin-orbit coupling the spin damping here is much lower.

Here, the most important contributions of spin-damping in organic semiconductors, such as a figure of merit for spin conductivity, and with it pathways to improve the properties of OSCs in the field of spintronics, are presented.
In more detail, a spin-OLED device is discussed which has been successfully built and tested recently.
