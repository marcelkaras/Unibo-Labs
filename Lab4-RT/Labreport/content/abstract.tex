By using a temperature dependent resistance measurement in the temperature range of $\SI{110}{\kelvin}$ to $\SI{450}{\kelvin}$ the characteristic proportionality of resitance and temperature of
metals(Copper, Nickel) and semiconductors (germanium) can be verified with microscopic models. The fitting of resistivity has been done in the high and low temperature regime, where for a chosen germanium sample the bandgap could be estimated.
In a second part, by measuring the resistance of wires for different lengths, but at room temperature, sucessfully an estimate for the material specific resistivity and thus the material could be done.
