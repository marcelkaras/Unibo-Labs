Constant and specific characterisitics of microfabricated microelectronics sets the basis of todays technology based society.
Here, a preparation of a full functioning photodetector on a conductorbased architecture is presented from the very fist steps of substrate cleaning to a resistivity characterization.
Interestingly, the active material used is a perovskite, deposited in two ways. 
The difference of using or not using an antisolvant for crystalization of the perovskite has, as the optical and electric
characterization shows, effects on the functionaly of the device.
